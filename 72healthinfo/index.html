          <h2>EAT HEALTHY - BE HEALTHY</h2>
          <p>Health food is a marketing term to suggest human health effects beyond a normal healthy diet required for human nutrition.<br><br> Foods marketed as health foods may be part of one or more categories, such as natural foods, organic foods, whole foods, vegetarian foods or dietary supplements.[citation needed] These products may be sold in health food stores or in the health food or organic sections of grocery stores. While there is no precise definition for "health food", the United States Food and Drug Administration monitors and warns food manufacturers against labeling foods as having specific health effects when no evidence exists to support such statements.</p>
